respected again all over the world.', 'We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.', 'During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.', 'Our sovereignty will be reclaimed.', 'Our safety will be restored.', 'The scales of justice will be rebalanced.', 'The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.', 'And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.', 'America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.', 'I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.', 'A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.', 'But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.', 'While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.', 'As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.', 'For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.', 'We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.', 'It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.', 'We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.', 'Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolinaâ\\x80\\x94who have been treated so badlyâ\\x80\\x94and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.',

change.', 'We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.', 'And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselvesâ\\x80\\x94in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.', 'All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.', 'My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.', 'From this moment on, Americaâ\\x80\\x99s decline is over.', 'Our liberties and our nationâ\\x80\\x99s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.', 'And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s government.', 'Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged

'Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.', 'Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassinâ\\x80\\x99s bullet ripped through my ear.', 'But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.', 'I was saved by God to make America great again.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you very much.', 'That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.', 'We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.', 'For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.', 'It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.', 'As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.', 'And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.', 'To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.', 'We set records, and I will not forget it.', 'Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.', 'Today is Martin Luther King Day.', 'And his honorâ\\x80\\x94this will be a great honor.', 'But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.', 'We will make his dream come true.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.', 'In

forget our God.', 'Canâ\\x80\\x99t do that.', 'Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.', 'With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.', 'Itâ\\x80\\x99s all about common sense.', 'First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.', 'All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.', 'We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.', 'I will end the practice of catch and release.', 'And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.', 'Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.', 'And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities.', 'As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.', 'We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.', 'Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.', 'The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.', 'We will drill, baby, drill.', 'America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever haveâ\\x80\\x94the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earthâ\\x80\\x94and we are going to use it.', 'Weâ\\x80\\x99ll use it.', 'We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.', 'We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.', 'With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.', 'In other words, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to buy the car of your choice.', 'We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.', 'And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.', 'We did tremendously with their vote.', 'I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.', 'Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.', 'For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.', 'It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.', 'The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.', 'To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.', 'After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.', 'Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponentsâ\\x80\\x94something I know something about.', 'We will not allow that to happen.', 'It will not happen again.', 'Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.', 'And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.', 'This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.', 'We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.', 'As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.', 'This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.', 'And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.', 'Itâ\\x80\\x99s going to end immediately.', 'Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating Americaâ\\x80\\x99s enemies.', 'Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.', 'We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we endâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.', 'My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.', 'Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.', 'Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.', 'Thank you.', 'America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.', 'A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.', 'President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talentâ\\x80\\x94he was a natural businessmanâ\\x80\\x94and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spatesâ\\x80\\x94the United States, I mean, think of thisâ\\x80\\x94spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.', 'We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panamaâ\\x80\\x99s promise to us has been broken.', 'The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.', 'American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.', 'And that includes the United States Navy.', 'And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.', 'And we didnâ\\x80\\x99t give it to China.', 'We gave it to Panama, and weâ\\x80\\x99re taking it back.', 'Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of historyâ\\x80\\x99s greatest civilization.', 'So, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.', 'We will not be deterred.', 'Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.', 'The United States will once again consider itself a growing nationâ\\x80\\x94one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.', 'And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.', 'Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other.', 'Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no nation like our nation.', 'Americans are

American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.', 'No one comes close.', 'Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.', 'They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.', 'If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.', 'Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.', 'But as you see today, here I am.', 'The American people have spoken.', 'I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.', 'In America, the impossible is what we do best.', 'From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.', 'They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.', 'Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism,

to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\", \"The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.\", 'The danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.', 'Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.', \"It was Miss\\nTaylor's loss which first brought grief.\", 'It was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.', 'The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.', 'Her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.', 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.', \"Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\", 'The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.', 'She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.', \"A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\", 'She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.', 'How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.', 'She dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.', 'He could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.', 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.', 'Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\\nbe struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\\nvisit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.', 'Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.', 'The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.', 'All looked up to them.', 'She had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\nTaylor for even half a day.', 'It was a melancholy change; and Emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.', 'His spirits required support.', 'He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.', \"Matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\", 'Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.', 'What a pity it\\nis that Mr. Weston ever thought of

'You got Hannah that good place.', 'Nobody thought\\nof Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"', '\"I am very glad I did think of her.', 'It was very lucky, for I would\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.', 'Whenever I see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.', 'I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.', 'Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.', 'He will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"', 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.', 'The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.', \"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.\", 'He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.', \"He had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked\\nup to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\", 'It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.', 'Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most

a shocking walk.\"', '\"Not at all, sir.', 'It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat I must draw back from your great fire.\"', '\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.', 'I wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"', '\"Dirty, sir!', 'Look at my shoes.', 'Not a speck on them.\"', '\"Well!', 'that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.', 'It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.', 'I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"', '\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.', 'Being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy

'\\'Tis a sad business.\"', '\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.\\'', 'I have a great regard for you and Emma;\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\\nany rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"', '\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"', 'said Emma playfully.', '\"That is what you have in your head,\\nI know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"', '\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a sigh.', '\"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"', '\"My dearest papa!', 'You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\\nMr. Knightley to mean _you_.', 'What a horrible idea!', 'Oh no!', 'I meant\\nonly myself.', 'Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--\\nin a joke--it is all a joke.', 'We always say what we like to one another.\"', 'Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma

for.\"', 'Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.', '\"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley.', '\"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\\nif we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nMiss Taylor\\'s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\\nat Miss Taylor\\'s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.', 'Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried.\"', '\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\\n\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.', 'I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\\nand be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"', 'Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.', 'Her father fondly replied,\\n\"Ah!', 'my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass.', 'Pray do not make any\\nmore matches.\"', '\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\\nfor other people.', 'It is the greatest amusement in the world!', 'And\\nafter such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again.', 'Oh dear, no!', 'Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\\nso long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\\nMr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it.', 'Oh no!', 'Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.', 'Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him.', 'All manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\\nof it.', '\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject.', 'I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\\noff match-making.\"', '\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,\\'\" said Mr. Knightley.', '\"Success supposes endeavour.', 'Your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage.', \"A worthy employment for a young\\nlady's mind!\", \"But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\\nas you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\\none idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\\nif Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?\", 'Where\\nis your merit?', 'What are you

yourself,\\nthan good to them, by interference.\"', '\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.', '\"But, my dear,\\npray do

him single any longer--and I thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him!', 'I think\\nvery well of Mr.

a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much\\nbetter thing.', 'Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.', 'Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care\\nof himself.\"', 'CHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property.', 'He had received a good education, but,\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.', 'Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\\nof a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\\nwith him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\\nwho had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\\nwhich the connexion would offend.', 'Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\\nof her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\\ntook place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\\nwho threw her off with due decorum.', 'It was an unsuitable connexion,\\nand did not produce much happiness.', 'Mrs. Weston ought to have found\\nmore in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\\nshe had not the best.', \"She had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\", 'They lived beyond\\ntheir income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\\nshe did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.', \"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\", 'From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.', \"The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\", 'Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\\nto have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could.', 'A complete change of life became desirable.', 'He quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.', 'It was a concern which brought just employment enough.', 'He had still\\na small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.', 'He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\\nalways longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition.', 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\\nlooked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\\nin view, till they were accomplished.', 'He had made his fortune,\\nbought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through.', 'He had never been an unhappy man;\\nhis own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\\namiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.', \"He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\\nhis own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\", \"It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\\nfather's assistance.\", 'His father had no apprehension of it.', \"The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\\nbut it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\\nso deservedly dear.\", 'He saw his son every year in London,\\nand was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.', 'He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern.', 'Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life.', 'His coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.', \"Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,\\nas a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.\", 'There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when\\nMrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates returned the visit.', 'Now was the time for Mr. Frank\\nChurchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.', 'For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.', '\"I suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written\\nto Mrs. Weston?', 'I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.', 'Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.', 'Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"', 'It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.', 'Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured.', 'She felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.', \"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\nwithout pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering\\nan hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\\nEmma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations.\", \"And then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's\\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together.\", \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her\\nsatisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,\\nwas so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\n`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.\", 'But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\\'s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor!', 'She would be very glad to stay.\"', 'There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto Mr. Woodhouse.', 'The compliments of his neighbours were over;\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;\\nand the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,\\nwas all eat up.', 'His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself.', \"What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;\\nand he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any body's eating it.\", 'He had been at the pains\\nof consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.', \"Mr. Perry\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree\\nwith many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.\", 'With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the\\ncake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone.', \"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their\\nhands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.\", 'CHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.', 'He liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\\nfrom his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,\\nfrom his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.', 'He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;\\nhis horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.', 'Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\\nand Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\\ncomprehended many such.', \"Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening\\nparties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.\", \"Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\\nand by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being\\nthrown away.\", 'After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able\\nof whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either James or the horses.', 'Had it\\ntaken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.', 'Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a\\nvery old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.', 'She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,\\nunder such untoward circumstances, can excite.', 'Her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,\\nhandsome, rich, nor married.', 'Miss Bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour;\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.', 'She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.', 'Her youth\\nhad passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible.', 'And yet she was a happy woman,\\nand a woman whom no one named without good-will.', 'It was her own\\nuniversal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.', \"She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,\\nquicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,\\nand so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing.\", 'The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,\\nher contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\\nand a mine of felicity to herself.', 'She was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip.', 'Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,\\nor an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but\\na real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education, without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies.', \"Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and\\nvery deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.\", 'It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church.', \"She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly\\nowed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,\\nwhenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\", \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,\\nin the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,\\nit was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.\", 'She was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.', 'As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,\\nin most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;\\na most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,\\nwhom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,\\non account of her beauty.', 'A very gracious invitation was returned,\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.', 'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.', \"Somebody had\\nplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,\\nand somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\\nto that of parlour-boarder.\", 'This was all that was generally known\\nof her history.', 'She had no visible friends but what had been\\nacquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit\\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.', 'She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired.', 'She was short, plump, and fair,\\nwith a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,\\nand a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,\\nEmma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance.', \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\\nand deserve encouragement.\", 'Encouragement should be given.', 'Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be\\nwasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.', 'The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.', 'The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort\\nof people, must be doing her harm.', 'They were a family of the name\\nof Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm\\nof Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,\\nshe believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they\\nmust be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates\\nof a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect.', '_She_ would notice her; she would improve her;\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.', 'It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.', 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\\nand listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\\nwhich always closed such parties, and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\\nand moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.', 'With an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,\\nwith the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.', 'Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.', 'He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.', 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\\nhe could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he\\nmight constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing\\nthe nicer things, to say:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.', 'An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.', 'Serle understands boiling\\nan egg better than any body.', 'I would not recommend an egg boiled\\nby any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,\\nyou see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.', 'Miss Bates,\\nlet Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.', 'Ours are all apple-tarts.', 'You need not be afraid of unwholesome\\npreserves here.', 'I do not advise the custard.', 'Mrs. Goddard, what say\\nyou to _half_ a glass of wine?', 'A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler\\nof water?', 'I do not think it could disagree with you.\"', 'Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in\\na much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had\\nparticular pleasure in sending them away happy.', 'The happiness\\nof Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.', 'Miss Woodhouse\\nwas so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the\\nintroduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,\\ngrateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,\\ndelighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated\\nher all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!', \"CHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHarriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.\", 'Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,\\nso did their satisfaction in each other.', 'As a walking companion,\\nEmma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.', \"In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.\", \"Her father\\nnever went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground\\nsufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;\\nand since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.\", 'She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;\\nand a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any\\ntime to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.', 'But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,\\nand was confirmed in all her kind designs.', 'Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,\\ngrateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to.', 'Her early attachment\\nto herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,\\nand power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that\\nthere was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must\\nnot be expected.', \"Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet\\nSmith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the\\nsomething which her home required.\", 'Such a friend as Mrs. Weston\\nwas out of the question.', 'Two such could never be granted.', 'Two such she did not want.', 'It was quite a different sort of thing,\\na sentiment distinct and independent.', 'Mrs. Weston was the object\\nof a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.', 'Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.', 'For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.', 'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell.', 'She was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.', 'Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never\\nbelieve that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered\\nthe truth.', 'Harriet had no penetration.', 'She had been satisfied\\nto hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;\\nand looked no farther.', 'Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and\\nbut for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,\\nit must have been the whole.', 'But the Martins occupied her thoughts\\na good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place.', 'Emma encouraged her\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin\\'s having \"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,\\nindeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard\\'s drawing-room;\\nand of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years\\nwith her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,\\nand one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;\\nand of Mrs. Martin\\'s saying as she was so fond of it, it should be\\ncalled _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house\\nin their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink\\ntea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.\"', 'For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;\\nbut as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.', \"She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,\\na son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared\\nthat the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always\\nmentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something\\nor other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,\\nno wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she\\nwere not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\", 'With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number\\nand meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it.', 'Harriet was very ready\\nto speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured\\nand obliging.', 'He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\\nher some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,\\nand in every thing else he was so very obliging.', \"He had his\\nshepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\", 'She was very fond of singing.', 'He could sing a little himself.', 'She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.', 'He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,\\nhe had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.', 'She believed every body spoke well of him.', 'His mother and sisters\\nwere very fond of him.', 'Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there\\nwas a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,\\nhe would make a good husband.', 'Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.', 'She was in no hurry at all.', '\"Well done, Mrs.', 'Martin!\"', 'thought Emma.', '\"You know what you are about.\"', '\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had\\never seen.', 'Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all\\nthe three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,\\nto sup with her.\"', '\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line\\nof his own business?', 'He does not read?\"', '\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has\\nread a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.', 'He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay\\nin one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.', 'But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read\\nsomething aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.', 'And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.', 'He never read the\\nRomance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.', 'He had never\\nheard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined\\nto get them now as soon as ever he can.\"', 'The next question was--\\n\\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr.', 'Martin?\"', '\"Oh!', 'not handsome--not at all handsome.', 'I thought him very plain\\nat first, but I do not think him so plain now.', 'One does not, you know,\\nafter a time.', 'But did you never see him?', 'He is in Highbury every\\nnow and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\\nto Kingston.', 'He has passed you very often.\"', '\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without\\nhaving any idea of his name.', 'A young farmer, whether on horseback\\nor on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.', 'The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I\\ncan have nothing to do.', 'A degree or two lower, and a creditable\\nappearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their\\nfamilies in some way or other.', 'But a farmer can need none of my help,\\nand is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every\\nother he is below it.\"', '\"To be sure.', 'Oh yes!', 'It is not likely you should ever have\\nobserved him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"', '\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.', 'I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.', 'What do you imagine his age to be?\"', '\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is\\nthe 23rd just a fortnight and a day\\'s difference--which is very odd.\"', '\"Only four-and-twenty.', 'That is too young to settle.', 'His mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry.', 'They seem very comfortable\\nas they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,\\nshe would probably repent it.', 'Six years hence, if he could meet\\nwith a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,\\nwith a little money, it might be very desirable.\"', '\"Six years hence!', 'Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"', '\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,\\nwho are not born to an independence.', 'Mr. Martin, I imagine,\\nhas his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with\\nthe world.', 'Whatever money he might come into when his father died,\\nwhatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,\\nall afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,\\nwith diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to\\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet.\"', '\"To be sure, so it is.', 'But they live very comfortably.', 'They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;\\nand Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.\"', '\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though\\nhis sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether\\nobjected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\\nfor you to notice.', 'The misfortune of your birth ought to make you\\nparticularly careful as to your associates.', 'There can be no doubt\\nof your being a gentleman\\'s daughter, and you must support your\\nclaim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there\\nwill be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.\"', '\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.', 'But while I visit\\nat Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,\\nI am not afraid of what any body can do.\"', '\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.', 'I want to see you\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable\\nto have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say\\nthat if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,\\nI wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,\\nto be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere\\nfarmer\\'s daughter, without education.\"', '\"To be sure.', 'Yes.', 'Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up.', \"However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I\\nam sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.\", 'I shall\\nalways have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,\\nand should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well\\neducated as me.', 'But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,\\ncertainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"', 'Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,\\nand saw no alarming symptoms of love.', \"The young man had been\\nthe first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,\\nand that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,\\nto oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.\", 'They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road.', 'He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully\\nat her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.', 'Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;\\nand walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made\\nher quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.', \"His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,\\nbut his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be\\ncontrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground\\nhe had gained in Harriet's inclination.\", \"Harriet was not insensible\\nof manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness\\nwith admiration as well as wonder.\", 'Mr. Martin looked as if he\\ndid not know what manner was.', 'They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must\\nnot be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a\\nsmiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse\\nhoped very soon to compose.', '\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd!', 'It was\\nquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.', 'He did not think we ever walked this road.', 'He thought we walked\\ntowards Randalls most days.', 'He has not been able to get the\\nRomance of the Forest yet.', 'He was so busy the last time he was\\nat Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.', 'So very odd we should happen to meet!', 'Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he\\nlike what you expected?', 'What do you think of him?', 'Do you think him\\nso very plain?\"', '\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility.', 'I had no\\nright to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no\\nidea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.', 'I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.\"', '\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not\\nso genteel as real gentlemen.\"', '\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,\\nthat you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.', 'At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,\\nwell bred men.', 'I should be surprized if, after seeing them,\\nyou could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving\\nhim to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at\\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.', 'Do not you begin to feel that now?', 'Were not you struck?', 'I am sure\\nyou must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,\\nand the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated\\nas I stood here.\"', '\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.', 'He has not such a fine\\nair and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.', 'I see the difference\\nplain enough.', 'But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"', '\"Mr. Knightley\\'s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\\nto compare Mr. Martin with _him_.', 'You might not see one in a hundred\\nwith _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.', 'But he is\\nnot the only gentleman you have been lately used to.', 'What say you\\nto Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton?', 'Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.', 'Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;\\nof being silent.', 'You must see the difference.\"', '\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.', 'But Mr. Weston is almost\\nan old man.', 'Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"', '\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.', 'The older a\\nperson grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners\\nshould not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,\\nor coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.', 'What is passable in youth\\nis detestable in later age.', 'Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;\\nwhat will he be at Mr. Weston\\'s time of life?\"', '\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.', '\"But there may be pretty good guessing.', 'He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking\\nof nothing but profit and loss.\"', '\"Will he, indeed?', 'That will be very bad.\"', '\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.', 'He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.', 'What has\\nhe to do with books?', 'And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,\\nand be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse\\nneed not disturb _us_.\"', '\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet\\'s answer,\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might\\nbe safely left to itself.', 'She, therefore, said no more for some time.', 'Her next beginning was,\\n\\n\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\'s manners are superior\\nto Mr. Knightley\\'s or Mr. Weston\\'s.', 'They have more gentleness.', 'They might be more safely held up as a pattern.', 'There is an openness,\\na quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body\\nlikes in _him_, because there is so much good-humour with it--but\\nthat would not do to be copied.', \"Neither would Mr. Knightley's\\ndownright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits\\n_him_ very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem\\nto allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,\\nhe would not be sufferable.\", 'On the contrary, I think a young man\\nmight be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.', 'Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.', 'He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.', 'I do not\\nknow whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\\nof us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his\\nmanners are softer than they used to be.', 'If he means any thing,\\nit must be to please you.', 'Did not I tell you what he said of you\\nthe other day?\"', 'She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\\nfrom Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed\\nand smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.', \"Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving\\nthe young farmer out of Harriet's head.\", 'She thought it would\\nbe an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,\\nand probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.', 'She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.', \"It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled\\nher in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during\\nthe very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.\", 'The longer\\nshe considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.', \"Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,\\nand without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family\\nthat could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\", 'He had a\\ncomfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;\\nfor though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly\\nof him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.', \"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,\\nwas foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be\\nlittle doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\\nthe usual weight and efficacy.\", 'And he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.', \"He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,\\nthough not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which\\nshe could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified\\nby a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts\\nfor her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.\", 'CHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"of\\nthis great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.\"', '\"A bad thing!', 'Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"', '\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"', '\"You surprize me!', 'Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her\\nwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.', 'I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.', 'How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any\\ngood!', 'This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\\nabout Emma, Mr.', 'Knightley.\"', '\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,\\nknowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"', '\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,\\nfor he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.', 'We were speaking\\nof it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,\\nthat there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.', 'Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.', 'You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value\\nof a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\\na woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used\\nto it all her life.', 'I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.', \"She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.\", 'But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,\\nit will be an inducement to her to read more herself.', 'They will\\nread together.', 'She means it, I know.\"', '\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\\nyears old.', 'I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at\\nvarious times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and\\nvery good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly\\narranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.', 'The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it\\ndid her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;\\nand I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.', 'But I\\nhave done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.', 'She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,\\nand a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.', 'Where Miss Taylor\\nfailed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do\\nnothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you\\nwished.--You know you could not.\"', '\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought\\nso _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma\\'s\\nomitting to do any thing I wished.\"', '\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"--said\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.', '\"But I,\"\\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,\\nmust still see, hear, and remember.', 'Emma is spoiled by being the\\ncleverest of her family.', 'At ten years old, she had the misfortune of\\nbeing able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.', 'She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.', 'And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house\\nand of you all.', 'In her mother she lost the only person able to cope\\nwith her.', 'She inherits her mother\\'s talents, and must have been\\nunder subjection to her.\"', '\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on\\n_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family and wanted\\nanother situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for\\nme to any body.', 'I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"', '\"Yes,\" said he, smiling.', '\"You are better placed _here_; very fit\\nfor a wife, but not at all for a governess.', 'But you were preparing\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.', 'You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would\\nseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_,\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,\\nand doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend\\nhim a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"', '\"Thank you.', 'There will be very little merit in making a good wife\\nto such a man as Mr.', 'Weston.\"', '\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,\\nand that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing\\nto be borne.', 'We will not despair, however.', 'Weston may grow cross\\nfrom the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.\"', '\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.', 'No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\"', '\"Not I, indeed.', 'I only name possibilities.', \"I do not pretend to Emma's\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing.\", 'I hope, with all my heart,\\nthe young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.', 'I think\\nher the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.', 'She knows nothing herself, and

temper and artlessness\\nin herself.', 'I have done very little.\"', '\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant\\nMr. Elton--\\n\\n\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,\\nhave taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her\\nway before.\"', '\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.', 'So much superadded\\ndecision of character!', 'Skilful has been the hand!\"', '\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.', 'I never met with\\na disposition more truly amiable.\"', '\"I have no doubt of it.\"', 'And it was spoken

any money for it.', 'I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.', 'You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had\\na great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of\\nmy friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.', 'But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.', 'But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.', 'It would be such a delight to have her picture!\"', '\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!', 'Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a\\ntalent in

my\\npicture be drawn?\\'\"', '\"Oh!', 'yes, I observed it, I assure you.', 'It was not lost on me.', 'But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"', 'Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\\npressing of both the others.', 'Emma wished to go to work directly,\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\\nat portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they\\nmight decide together on the best size for Harriet.', 'Her many\\nbeginnings were displayed.', 'Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.', 'She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress\\nboth in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\\nlabour as she would ever submit to.', 'She played and sang;--and drew\\nin almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\\nwould have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.', 'She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\\nor a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\\nthan it deserved.', 'There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;\\nher style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same.', 'They were both in ecstasies.', \"A likeness\\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\", '\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma.', '\"I had only my\\nown family to study from.', 'There is my father--another of my\\nfather--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,\\nthat I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very\\nlike therefore.', 'Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.', 'Dear Mrs. Weston!', 'always my kindest friend on every occasion.', 'She would sit whenever I asked her.', 'There is my sister; and really\\nquite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.', 'I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have\\nsat longer,

children ever were.\", 'Here is my sketch of the fourth,\\nwho was a baby.', 'I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it\\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.', 'He had nestled down his head most conveniently.', \"That's very like.\", 'I am rather proud of little George.', 'The corner of the sofa is very good.', 'Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my brother,\\nMr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I\\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.', 'I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I\\nhad really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too\\nflattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\\nall this, came poor dear Isabella\\'s cold approbation of--\"Yes,\\nit was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\"', 'We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.', 'It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I\\ncould bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised\\nover as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in\\nBrunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing\\nany body again.', 'But for Harriet\\'s sake, or rather for my own,\\nand as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,\\nI will break my resolution now.\"', 'Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,\\nand was repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present\\nindeed, as you observe.', 'Exactly so.', 'No husbands and wives,\"\\nwith so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider\\nwhether she had not better leave them together at once.', 'But as she\\nwanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.', 'She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.', \"It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John\\nKnightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,\\nto hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.\", 'The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid\\nof not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.', 'But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind\\nher and watching every touch.', 'She gave him credit for stationing\\nhimself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;\\nbut was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to\\nplace himself elsewhere.', 'It then occurred to her to employ him\\nin reading.', '\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed!', 'It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith\\'s.\"', 'Mr. Elton was only too happy.', 'Harriet listened, and Emma drew\\nin peace.', 'She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;\\nany thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;\\nand he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,\\nto jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no\\nbeing displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration\\nmade him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.', 'She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance\\nwere unexceptionable.', \"The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite\\nenough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.\", \"There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,\\nand as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,\\nto give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had\\ngreat confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,\\nand of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a\\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,\\nand the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations\\nas Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.\", 'Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.', '\"By all means.', 'We shall be most happy to consider you as one\\nof the party.\"', 'The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress\\nof the picture, which was rapid and happy.', 'Every body who saw it\\nwas pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended\\nit through every criticism.', '\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting\\nthat she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is\\nmost correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and

feature.', 'I never saw such a likeness in my life.', 'We must allow for the effect\\nof shade, you know.\"', '\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.', 'Emma knew that she had, but

propriety, even delicacy of feeling.', 'She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for\\nher opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last forced to add,\\n\"Is it a good letter?',

be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions.', 'I am quite determined to refuse him.', 'But how shall I do?', 'What shall I say?\"', 'Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,\\nand advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,\\nin the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest\\nagainst any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the\\nformation of every sentence.', 'The looking over his letter again,\\nin replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was\\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;\\nand she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,\\nand thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,\\nand was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,\\nthat Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,\\nhe would have been accepted after all.', 'This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.', 'The business was finished, and Harriet safe.', 'She was rather low\\nall the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,\\nand sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own

very well married,\\nand it is only a linen-draper.\"', '\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\nteacher of a school, Harriet.', 'I dare say Miss Nash would envy you\\nsuch an opportunity as this of being married.', 'Even this conquest\\nwould appear valuable in her eyes.', 'As to any thing superior for you,\\nI suppose she is quite in the dark.', 'The attentions of a certain\\nperson can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.', 'Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks\\nand manners have explained themselves.\"', 'Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering\\nthat people should like her so much.', 'The idea of Mr. Elton was\\ncertainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted\\nagain towards the rejected Mr. Martin.', '\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly.', '\"I wonder what they\\nare all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,\\nthey will be unhappy too.', 'I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"', '\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\ncheerfully employed,\" cried Emma.', '\"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\nis shewing your

was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples\\nof his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.', 'Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was

him.', 'I was very much pleased with all that he said.', 'I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.', 'He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very\\nwell judging.', 'He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,\\nand what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.', 'He is\\nan excellent young man, both as son and brother.', 'I had no hesitation\\nin advising him to marry.', 'He proved to me that he could afford it;\\nand that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.', 'I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.', 'If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought\\nhighly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the\\nbest friend and counsellor man ever had.', 'This happened the night\\nbefore last.', 'Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should\\nbe at Mrs. Goddard\\'s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,\\nwithout thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"', '\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\\ndid not speak yesterday?\"', '\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not

up, in tall indignation, and said,\\n\\n\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.', 'What is the foolish girl about?\"', '\"Oh!', 'to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always

any that can avail her.', 'She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.', 'My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being\\nbeneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.', 'I felt that,\\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.', 'But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing\\nto trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort\\nof disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led\\naright and turn out very well.',

statement\\nby no means fair.', \"You are not just to Harriet's claims.\", 'They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;\\nMr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is

allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged\\nfor her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman\\'s daughter,\\nis indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen\\'s daughters,\\nno one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"', '\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may\\nhave had the charge of her, it does not

to take up her own line of the subject again.', '\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\nare unjust to Harriet.', \"Harriet's claims to marry well are not\\nso

enough for her.', 'Vanity working on a weak head,\\nproduces every sort of mischief.', 'Nothing so easy as for a young lady\\nto raise her expectations too high.', 'Miss Harriet Smith may not find\\noffers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.', 'Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.', 'Men of family would not be very fond of

for her.', 'She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little\\ntime and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.', \"Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.\", \"The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's\\nthat morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,\\ngave alarming ideas.\", \"The dread of such a failure after all became the\\nprominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,\\nand without having any such reason to give for her long absence,\\nshe felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,\\nand convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,\\nshe had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings\\nwould not justify.\", \"He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,\\nneither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,\\nin spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such\\nan observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it\\nhastily and in anger, she was able to

make due allowance for the influence\\nof a strong passion at war with all interested motives.', 'Mr. Knightley\\nsaw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;\\nbut she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;\\nand more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very\\nsure did not belong to Mr. Elton.', \"Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,\\nnot to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.\", 'Miss Nash\\nhad been telling her something,

was the whist-club night, which he had been\\nnever known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him\\nabout it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,\\nto absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off\\nhis journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been\\ndetermined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way

precious.\", 'Mr. Perry\\ncould not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must\\nbe a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only\\nlooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.', 'Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more\\nabout Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\\n\"that she did not pretend to

mental provision she was making for the evening of life,\\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\\nthat she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,\\nmade up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.\", 'In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale\\nare not uncommon.', \"Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs.

entered into\\ntheir troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance\\nwith as much intelligence as good-will.', 'In the present instance,\\nit was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;\\nand after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,\\nshe quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\\nas made her say to Harriet, as they walked

has done all that is truly important.', 'If we feel for the wretched,\\nenough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,\\nonly distressing to ourselves.\"', 'Harriet could just answer, \"Oh!', 'dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\\njoined them.', 'The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,\\nwere the first subject on meeting.', 'He had been going to call\\non them.', 'His visit he would now defer; but they had a very\\ninteresting parley about what could be done and should be done.', 'Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.', '\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\\n\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side.', 'I should not wonder if it were to bring\\non the declaration.', 'It must, if I were not here.', 'I wish I were\\nanywhere else.\"', 'Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised\\non one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.', \"But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's\\nhabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,\\nin short, they would both be soon after her.\", 'This would not do;\\nshe immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration\\nto make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete\\noccupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,\\nand she would follow in half a minute.', 'They did as they were desired;\\nand by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,\\nshe had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken\\nby a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,\\nwith her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.', 'To walk by the side\\nof this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural\\nthing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been\\nacting just then without design; and by this means the others were\\nstill able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.', \"She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick,\\nand theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,\\nfrom their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.\", 'Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very\\npleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning\\nto think how she might draw back a little more, when they both\\nlooked around, and she was obliged to join them.', \"Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's\\nparty at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for\\nthe Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,\\nthe beet-root, and all the dessert.\", '\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love;\\nand any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.', 'If I could but have kept longer away!\"', 'They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into\\nthe house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more.', 'She then broke the lace\\noff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently\\nobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to\\nput herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.', '\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am\\nto contrive.', 'I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,\\nbut I hope I am not often so ill-equipped.', 'Mr. Elton, I must beg\\nleave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit\\nof ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"', 'Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\\nhis house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.', 'The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,\\nand looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately\\ncommunicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed\\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\\ncomfortable manner.', 'She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\\nfound it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.', 'It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging\\nthe housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it\\npracticable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.', 'For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.', 'It could\\nbe protracted no longer.', 'She was then obliged to be finished,\\nand make her appearance.', 'The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.', 'It had a\\nmost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory\\nof having schemed successfully.', 'But it would not do; he had not\\ncome to the point.', 'He had been most agreeable, most delightful;\\nhe had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely\\nfollowed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,\\nbut nothing serious.', '\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch,\\nand will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"', 'Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished\\nby her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself\\nthat it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,\\nand must be leading them forward to the great event.', 'CHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself.', \"It was no longer in Emma's\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.\", \"The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,\\nthat first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth\\nher prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay\\nat Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--\\nthat any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could\\nbe afforded by her to the lovers.\", 'They might advance rapidly\\nif they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether\\nthey would or no.', 'She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.', 'There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will\\ndo for themselves.', 'Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual\\nabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the\\nusual interest.', \"Till this year, every long vacation since their\\nmarriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;\\nbut all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing\\nfor the children, and it was therefore many months since they had\\nbeen seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all\\nby Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,\\neven for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most\\nnervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.\", 'He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\\nbring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms\\nwere needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,\\nand Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent\\nnumber of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.', 'The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,\\nwelcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,\\nproduced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\\nunder any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;\\nbut the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were\\nso respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,\\nand for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,\\nall the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,\\nthe children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,\\neither in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.', 'Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,\\nand so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for\\nthese higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.', 'She could never see a fault in any of them.', 'She was not a woman\\nof strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance\\nof her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;\\nwas delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,\\nhad many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield\\nin town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.', 'They were alike too,\\nin a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard\\nfor every old acquaintance.', 'Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his\\nprivate character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.', 'He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross\\nas to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his\\ngreat perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,\\nit was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\\nbe increased.', 'The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.', 'He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,\\nand he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.', 'He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law.', 'Nothing\\nwrong in him escaped her.', 'She was quick in feeling the little\\ninjuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.', \"Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\\nflattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly\\nkind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;\\nbut hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\\nregardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\\nfell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.\", 'There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.', \"Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\\nhim to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.\", \"It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great\\nregard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was\\ndue to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as\\nthere was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,\\nthough the offence came not.\", 'The beginning, however, of every visit\\ndisplayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity\\nso short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.', \"They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's\\nattention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\", '\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"', '\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must\\nmiss her!', 'And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--\\nI have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could\\npossibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope\\nshe is pretty well, sir.\"', '\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know\\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably.\"', 'Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.', '\"Oh!', 'no--none in the least.', 'I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--\\nnever looking so well.', 'Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"', '\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.', '\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\"', 'asked Isabella\\nin the plaintive tone which just suited her father.', 'Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"', '\"Oh!', 'papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\\nthey married.', 'Either in the morning or evening of every day,\\nexcepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,\\nand generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you\\nmay suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.', 'They are very,\\nvery kind in their visits.', 'Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.', 'Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving\\nIsabella a false idea of us all.', 'Every body must be aware that Miss\\nTaylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured\\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any\\nmeans to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.\"', '\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\\nit was from your letters.', 'Her wish of shewing you attention could\\nnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\\nall easy.', 'I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea\\nof the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;\\nand now you have Emma\\'s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"', '\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot deny\\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--\\nbut then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"', '\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--\\nYou quite forget poor Mr.', 'Weston.\"', '\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston\\nhas some little claim.', 'You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part\\nof the poor husband.', 'I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,\\nthe claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.', 'As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience\\nof putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"', '\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\\n\"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,\\na greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been\\nfor the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought\\nof Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;\\nand as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve.', 'I believe he is one of the\\nvery best-tempered men that ever existed.', 'Excepting yourself\\nand your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.', 'I shall\\nnever forget his flying Henry\\'s kite for him that very windy day\\nlast Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September\\ntwelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o\\'clock at night,\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,\\nI have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\\na better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be\\nMiss Taylor.\"', '\"Where is the young man?\"', 'said John Knightley.', '\"Has he been here\\non this occasion--or has he not?\"', '\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma.', '\"There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended\\nin nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"', '\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.', '\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,\\nand a very proper, handsome letter it was.', 'She shewed it to me.', 'I thought it very well done of him indeed.', 'Whether

and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.', 'The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,\\npoor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a\\ndistance from.', 'She would be a loser in every way.', 'Emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.', 'In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\\nbut for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.', 'In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.', 'Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\\nnot like Mr. Elton.', 'Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,\\nso truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\\nof Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men\\nin one year.', 'CHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting.', 'Their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter.', 'How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!', 'Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nIt might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.', \"She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\", 'Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.', \"Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\\nunder her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,\\nEmma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\\nHarriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\", \"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she\\ncould talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.\", \"The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\", 'She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied.', 'There was a communication\\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.', 'No additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,\\nto crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.', 'She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--\\nShe ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.', 'It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.', 'She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\\nJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\\nThe fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\\nof their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\\nShe heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nMiss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\\nforward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\\nEmma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.', 'There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\nfeeling tone,\\n\\n\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible\\nfor me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being\\nso entirely without words.\"', \"Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,\\nif the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not\\nchecked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest\\nshake of the hand.\", 'Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.', 'Miss Bates was out,\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity.', 'Emma could have\\nwished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.', \"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,\\nand understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;\\nit was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people.\", 'Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;\\nand while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\\nto attend to the good old lady\\'s replies, she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\n\\n\"We can finish this some other time, you know.', 'You and I shall\\nnot want opportunities.', 'And, in fact, you have heard all the\\nessential already.', 'I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\\nour apology, and

observe.--Oh!', 'no; cautious as\\na minister of state.', 'I managed it extremely well.\"', 'Emma could not doubt.', 'It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion.', 'When they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\n\\n\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the\\nhighest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)', 'Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--\\nOh!', 'if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"', '--\\nAnd when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,\\n\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;\\nnot a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh!', 'no;\\nPerry shall have all the credit.\"', '\"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nshe shortly afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill.', 'Very pleasant party.', 'But yet I think there was something wanting.', 'Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon\\nthe spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might\\nbe mistaken.', 'However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one\\nto go again.', 'What say you both to our collecting the same party,\\nand exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--\\nIt must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\\nnot _one_ exception.\"', 'Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,\\nfrom doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.', '\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane\\'s prospects--\\nthat is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--\\nHow is Mr.',

'Perry!--\\nsuch attention to Jane!\"', '--And from her great, her more than commonly\\nthankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed\\nthat there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,\\nfrom the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--\\nAfter a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,\\nMrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,\\nthat anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;\\nbut, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and

rational.', \"Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put\\nthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;\\nand she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\", 'The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined.', \"The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for security.--What had she to wish for?\", 'Nothing, but to\\ngrow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own.', 'Nothing, but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.', 'Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\\nof them.', 'She must laugh at such a close!', 'Such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back!', 'Such a heart--such a Harriet!', 'Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\\nbe a pleasure.', 'It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.', 'High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nMr. Knightley would soon be over.', 'The disguise, equivocation,\\nmystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.', 'She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.', 'In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\\nnot always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\\nand, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,\\nor poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.', 'They arrived.--Mrs.', 'Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.', '\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.', '\"I was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning.', 'He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"', 'In half a minute they were in the room.', 'Emma was extremely glad\\nto see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side.', 'They met readily and smiling,\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\\nand having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\\nwhich she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\\nand of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.', 'When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\\nwas fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\\nor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\\nand say,\\n\\n\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of Mrs. Weston\\'s letters.', 'I hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon.', 'I hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said.\"', '\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.', 'I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\\nyou joy in person.\"', 'He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.', '\"Is not she looking well?\"', 'said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.', '\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\\nMrs. Weston doat upon her.\"', 'But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named\\nthe name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing.', '\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"', '\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.', 'But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.', 'Early, I know,\\nyou had none.\"', '\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"', '\"That appears quite wonderful.', 'I was once very near--and I wish I had--\\nit would have been better.', 'But though I was always doing wrong things,\\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--\\nIt would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing.\"', '\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.', '\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle\\'s being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.', 'When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,\\nand continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,\\nI am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--\\nTill this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.', 'Do not you pity me?\"', 'Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought, he cried,\\n\\n\"Ah!', 'by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\\nthe moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"', 'He paused.--She coloured\\nand laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour.', 'Let me return your congratulations.--\\nI assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"', 'Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown Jane, and his next words were,\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness!', 'such delicacy!--\\nand yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.', 'It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--\\na most distinguishing complexion!', 'So peculiarly the lady in it.--\\nJust colour enough for beauty.\"', '\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not\\nI remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--\\nWhen we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"', '\"Oh!', 'no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could\\nnot help saying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--\\nI am sure it was a consolation to you.\"', '\"Oh!', 'no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?', 'I was the most miserable wretch!\"', '\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.', 'I am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking\\nus all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell\\nyou the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation.', 'I think there is a little likeness between us.\"', 'He bowed.', '\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of\\ntrue sensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own.\"', '\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly.', '\"No, not true on your side.', 'You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.', 'Look at her.', 'Is not she an angel in every gesture?', 'Observe the turn\\nof her throat.', \"Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--\\nYou will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.\", 'They are to be\\nnew set.', 'I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.', 'Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?\"', '\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,\\nthat he gratefully burst out,\\n\\n\"How delighted I am to see you again!', 'and to see you in such\\nexcellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.', 'I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"', \"The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,\\nfrom the infant's appearing not quite well.\", 'She believed she had\\nbeen foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for Mr. Perry.', 'Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,\\nbut Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,\\nhowever, the child had been perfectly well again.', 'This was\\nher history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,\\nand only regretted that she had not done it.', '\"She should always send\\nfor Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,\\nwere it only for a moment.', 'She could not be too soon alarmed,\\nnor send for Perry too often.', 'It was a pity, perhaps, that he\\nhad not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry\\nhad seen it.\"', 'Frank Churchill caught the name.', '\"Perry!\"', \"said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax's eye.\", '\"My friend Mr. Perry!', 'What are they saying\\nabout Mr.', 'Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does\\nhe travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"', \"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined\\nin the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\", '\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\"', 'he cried.', '\"I can never think\\nof it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.', 'I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.', 'Look at her.', 'Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage\\nof her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to\\nnothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\"', 'Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,\\nlow, yet steady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--\\nThey _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"', \"He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;\\nbut Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on\\nleaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,\\nshe felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never\\nbeen more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.\", 'The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.', 'CHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.', 'A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\\nthan she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--\\nthat Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.', \"Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\\nand self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\\nher friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\\nHarriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nAstley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight.\", 'But what did such particulars explain?--\\nThe fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\\nalways liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\\nto Emma.', \"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.\", 'She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\\nof gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\\nIt was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many\\na gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nMr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr.', 'Elton!--\\nThe stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,\\nwould have been a stain indeed.', \"No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was\\ntreated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became\\nacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend.\", \"She had no doubt\\nof Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\\nand in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\\nof security, stability, and improvement.\", 'She would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.', 'She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.', 'She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,\\nto yield only to herself.', 'Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--\\nThe intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\\nto be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,\\nnatural manner.', 'Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,\\nas no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood\\nbefore them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\\nscarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\\naltar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,\\nthe latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.', 'Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.', 'The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,\\nby Emma and Mr.', \"Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage\\nought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,\\nto allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,\\nwhich was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,\\nwere agreed in approving it.\", 'But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse\\nto be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their\\nmarriage but as a distant event.', 'When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\\nwere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\\nHe began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\\na very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.', 'Still, however, he was not happy.', \"Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\\nthat his daughter's courage failed.\", 'She could not bear to see\\nhim suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though\\nher understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the\\nMr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.', \"In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nMrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.\", \"Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nMr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.\", 'The strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.', 'While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\\nBut Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the\\nfirst week in November.', 'The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert\\nMartin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.', 'The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"', '--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.',
